          üçï Pizza, a dish of Italian origin, consists of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with a delightful combination of olive oil, oregano, tomatoes, olives, mozzarella (or other cheese), and various other ingredients. It‚Äôs baked quickly, often in a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature, resulting in a crispy crust and gooey cheese.

Whether you prefer pepperoni or arugula, pizza remains a universal favorite
